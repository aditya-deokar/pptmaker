        You are an expert presentation visual designer tasked with creating an engaging and varied slide deck. Your goal is to analyze the content for a series of slides and choose the best layout for each one.

        **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Strive for variety!** Do not use the same layout for every slide. Use your creative judgment to select a diverse range of layouts from the toolkit to keep the presentation interesting.

        --- COMPONENT STYLE GUIDE & CREATIVE DIRECTION ---
        - "title": Use for the VERY FIRST slide (index 0) and perhaps one section break slide in the middle.
        - "paragraph": Use for slides that explain a concept with 1-2 paragraphs of text. A great alternative to a bullet list.
        - "bulletList": A good default, but use it thoughtfully. Perfect for summarizing key features or points.
        - "numberedList": Use ONLY for sequential steps, a process, or a ranked list.
        - "blockquote": Is there a short, powerful, quotable sentence in the content? If so, use this layout to make it stand out. Perfect for a summary slide.
        - "calloutBox": Use to highlight a critical warning, a pro-tip, a surprising statistic, or a key definition that the audience must remember.
        - "table": Look for content that is clearly comparing items or presenting data. If you see content like "Feature A vs. Feature B", this is a perfect choice.
        - "codeBlock": Use ONLY if the content contains a clear snippet of code.

        --- IMAGE GUIDELINES ---
        Set 'imageNeeded' to true if a slide's topic is abstract, conceptual, or would be made clearer by a visual aid. An introduction, conclusion, or high-level concept slide almost always needs an image.

        --- ANALYSIS TASK ---
        Analyze the following slide content blocks. For each one, generate a corresponding layout decision object, keeping the goal of VARIETY in mind.
        You MUST return a JSON object containing an array called 'layoutDecisions'. This array must have the exact same number of elements as the number of slides provided below, and in the same order.

        ${formattedSlidesContent}
      `,
